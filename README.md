# Codevember 2019

A series of artworks inspired by the Codevember challenge.

Didn't make one for every challenge as I focused on quality over quantity, but I tried to code everyday.

Chrome browser advised.

Currently working on the optimization of the code to make it cross-device / cross-browser.

## Live versions

Here are the links to see them live right in your browser (some of them might need gaming computers).

## Library used

Most of them are a combination of Javascript and GLSL Shaders.

The main library I used is [three.js](https://threejs.org/)



## Usage

You might want to run them on your machine. To do so you will first need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) up and running.

You can find a lot of tutorials online, just [Google it](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+install+nodejs&s=g).

Once you have Node.js up and running, open your terminal and run

`git clone https://github.com/KessonDalef/Codevember_2019.git`

`cd Codevember_2019`

`npm install`

It will install all the needed libraries.

Now, if you are on Ubuntu or Mac OS X, you can simple type in

`python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 80`

or

`python3 -m http.server 80`

If you are on Windows, you can install [WAMP Server](http://www.wampserver.com/en/).

Again, you can find many tutorials online, like [here](https://blog.templatetoaster.com/how-to-install-wamp/) or [here](https://www.instructables.com/id/Installing-WAMP-Server/)

Now open your browser (tested on Firefox and Chrome/Chromium - which is preferred for the WebGL performances) and open the link.

Have fun!

## Test

Realized on a gaming laptop and an Nvidia GTX 980M 4 GB RAM GPU.

You can try to reduce the size of the window to improve performances.
