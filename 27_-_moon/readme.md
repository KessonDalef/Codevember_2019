## Synopsis

Melting on itself, constructingnon-constant identities, incoherent in space and time, establishing itself a dynamic and generative loop between order and chaos, liquid moon was inspired by the moon in slithgly cloudy, foggy nights, and it is a constantly changing digital one, impossible to grasp.

liquid moon is real time generative and was developed in GLSL and compiled in WebGL2 using the JavaScript framework Three.js. The algorithm involves random functions, Perlin noise and trigonometry.
