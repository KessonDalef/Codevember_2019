## Concept

The Amazon fires have captured the attention of the world, and for good reasons: the destruction of one of the world major carbon stores, considered as “the lungs of the world”, could strike a devastating blow to the fight against the climate change, and to the home of indigenous communities. Amazon fires increased by 84% compared to the same period last year, according to the satellite images by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research. Yet, cattle ranching, logging and the production of soybeans was not only the plague for the deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest, but it affects other parts of the world, like the Cerrado (one of the world’s most biodiverse regions), which is 50% deforested, or the Rainforest in Indonesia. Still, is not everything: the biggest number of fires, in the month of August was in Russia, followed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Brazil, according to the satellite images of NASA and VIIRS.

Blazing World is an artistic data visualization which creates a map of the world made just with the fires. The red dots are the fires happened in the timeframe of 24h around the world (the brighter the pixel is, the warmer the fire was) on the 8th of November 2019 (the day of the codevember challenge). It is an ongoing work I am doing with satellite images of fires around the world, and is also an A/V performance I am working on and an interactive installation (also work in progress).
