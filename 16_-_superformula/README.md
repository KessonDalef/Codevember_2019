The superformula is a generalization of the superellipse and was proposed by Johan Gielis around 2000.[1] Gielis suggested that the formula can be used to describe many complex shapes and curves that are found in nature. Gielis has filed a patent application related to the synthesis of patterns generated by the superformula.
